            Megan is a proven community builder and event manager. Her experience includes exceeding retention goals for the Pyramid Club year after year. Then in June of 2014, she joined the McConnell Johnson Real Estate team to create and direct their newest endeavor, 1313 Innovation - a co-working space for startups and nonprofits. During the last year Megan has attracted a variety of startups/companies to 1313 and has planned nearly a hundred events, including Delaware's largest tech conference, Tech2gether.

When she isn't in Wilmington, Megan enjoys traveling, cheering on her alma mater, Temple University or trying to convince her husband to get a puppy.
